# Modern CSS Boilerplate

This project is a no bullshit CSS boilerplate using modern style authoring techniques. It covers all html elements and uses smart selectors to avoid style overrites. It has a simple implementation of a basic style system and uses variables for common values; as such, it uses no arbitrary or "magic" numbers. The typography is calcuated using a modular scale and the spacing system is build on the base line height.

I've included some suggested selectors and basic styles for common UI elements, like buttons, as well as some commented out features like adding an icon on out-bound links or links that open a PDF. Each selector was designed to create the lease amount of friction when building new UIs and encourage accessible markup. If you'd like to read more about the selector process, check out my [blog post](https://www.mattmcadams.com/thoughts/smart-selectors). Or read through the source, its just over 1000 lines with a lot of blank lines and comments.

I've been using this boilerplate for a while, making small tweaks and bug fixes as I've adapted it to work with many different projects. It's a breeze to build on and easy to edit. Rip out what you don't want, it's all throughly commented, and add in what you need.
