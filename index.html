        <h1>UA Type Workshop</h1>
        <p>This is a playground for typography and space for the design system at the University of Alabama.</p>
        <p>The space-type system is based on an 8px (0.5rem) grid, with a 4px (0.25rem) type grid. The typography is loosly based on a modular scale with a perfect fifth (2:3) ratio, but deviates to deliver sizes in whole pixels, and line heights that conform to the type grid. This means that there are never half pixels, and numbers can be translated 1:1 into design software.</p>
        <p>In practice, this will create 9 CSS variables to cover space, and 6 to cover typography.</p>

        <h2>Second level heading, extra long to test line height</h2>
        <p>Thirty-six current UA faculty have received NSF CAREER Awards, the nation’s most prestigious recognition of top-performing young scientists, in disciplines ranging from nanoscience and engineering to biological sciences. During the 2019-2020 academic year, seven professors received this award, the most awards in a single year at UA. And 52 UA faculty researchers are in the National Academy of Inventors.</p>
        <p>UA’s Capstone Agency was awarded Best Student-Run Firm by the Public Relations Student Society of America for the third time in 2020.</p>

        <h3>Third level heading, extra long to test line height and max heading length</h3>
        <p>At 38,320 students, UA enrolled the largest freshmen class in history in fall 2021. It is the third year out of the last four years with a fall enrollment of more than 38,000 students. Graduate School enrollment of 6,152 is a 7% increase from fall 2020 and breaks last year's record enrollment number.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a member of The University of Alabama community, I will pursue knowledge, act with fairness, integrity and respect; promote equity and inclusion; foster individual and civic responsibility; and strive for excellence in all I do." </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Caroline Yuk, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary studies through New College, was among 46 Americans selected to study in the United Kingdom through the prestigious Marshall Scholarship. Yuk is the third UA student to win the award and first in more than 40 years.</p>

        <h3>Lorem Ipsom</h3>
        <p>The University of Alabama will not require standardized ACT or SAT scores from students applying through the Fall 2022 Semester. Admission consideration for freshman entering through the Fall 2022 Semester will be based on a holistic review. Holistic admissions at The University of Alabama includes both academic and non-academic criteria.</p>

        <h4>Fourth level heading, extra long to test line height and max heading length. It takes a long title to wrap, so this is unlikely</h4>
        <p>There are two ways in which students can be eligible for scholarships under UA’s current test optional admission policy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Competitive Scholarships</strong> – The competitive scholarship application is part of your application for admission. Students who elect not to send a test score are eligible for competitive scholarship consideration if their application for admission and supporting documentation is submitted by January 15. </li>
          <li><strong>Automatic Merit Scholarships</strong> – To qualify for automatic merit scholarships, students must provide a test score and official transcript. Applicants may indicate that they do not want their test scores included in the review of their application for admission and still submit test scores for automatic merit scholarship consideration by May 1.</li>
        </ul>
